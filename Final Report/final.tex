\section{Overview}

Development of the Race the Wild app for Android has, on the whole, been quite successful. 
In the first week, an initial proposal was presented to and accepted by the client. 
Over the following week, a formal requirements document was prepared. 
Four weekly prototypes were delivered over the course of the project, with broadly the planned features implemented. 
After the second prototype, the project scope was expanded beyond the initial requirements based on client feedback. 
The final product meets all of the requirements as set out in the requirements document, as well as containing these extra features. 
As such, the project can be considered a success.
